Statement (a : ℕ → ℝ) (ha : ∀ n, a n = n)
      : ¬ ∃ σ, Subseq σ ∧ SeqConv (a ∘ σ) := by
intro h
choose σ σ_subseq hσ using h
choose L hL using hσ
choose M Mpos hM using BddOfConv (a ∘ σ) L hL
let n : ℕ := ⌈M⌉₊ + 1
have hn : (n : ℝ) = ⌈M⌉₊ + 1 := by exact_mod_cast (by rfl)
have hn' : M ≤ ⌈M⌉₊ := by bound
have hn'' : M < n := by bound
specialize hM n
change |a (σ n)| ≤ M at hM
rewrite [ha] at hM
have f1 : n ≤ σ n := by apply SubseqGe σ_subseq
have f2 : (0 : ℝ) ≤ σ n := by exact_mod_cast (by bound)
rewrite [(by apply abs_of_nonneg f2 : |(σ n : ℝ)| = (σ n))] at hM
have f3 : (n : ℝ) ≤ σ n := by exact_mod_cast f1
linarith [f3, hM, hn'']

Conclusion "Done."
